# Genius KSDK
This class is designed to work with the Keap REST API using a Personal Access 
Token or a Service Account Key.

The class is **not** designed to work with the OAuth2 Authentication.

_Testing proves that this authentication method can also use a Legacy API Key,
but it would be better to use a Service Account Key._

##Why use this PHP class?##
Here's a quick list of the benefits for using this PHP class to access the Keap
REST API.

- Does **NOT** require creating a Keap developer app
- Does **NOT** require OAuth2 authentication
- Does **NOT** require Composer
- **CAN** be used with a single access key
